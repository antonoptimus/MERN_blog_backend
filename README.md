## Tech Stack ⚙️

- **NodeJS:** Used for executing server-side JavaScript with support for ES6 modules.

- **Express:** Web server providing request handling and validation through the Validator library.

- **MongoDB / Mongoose:** Utilized for storing data in the MongoDB database, with interactions facilitated through the Mongoose library.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT):** Implemented for authentication and authorization. A unique web token is generated for each user.

- **Multer:** Library enabling the upload of files and images to the server.

- **BCrypt:** Employed for password encryption, preventing the storage of passwords in plain text.

## Running the Server 💻

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run start:dev`

The backend is launched on the machine using the Express library.

## Data Storage 📂

User data is stored in the MongoDB database, including information about users, posts, and other entities supported by the project.

## File and Image Upload 📥

The Multer library is used to enable the upload of images and files to the server, enhancing the project's functionality by allowing users to interact with multimedia content.

## Password Encryption 🔒

To ensure security, user passwords are encrypted using the BCrypt library during registration.

## Authentication using JWT 🛡️

A unique JWT is generated for each user, which is used for authentication. The server verifies the validity of the token, and if the token is valid, authentication is considered successful.
